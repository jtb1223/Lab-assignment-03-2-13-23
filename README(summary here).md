I wrote notes above the code to show how i got to my conclusion that the time complexity is bigO(n) / linear
I basically explained my thought process that because the f(n) or increment1, f2(n) or increment2, and f3(n) or sz
all only incremented by 1 in total.
from line 16 to 24, the may have increamented at the same time meaning 2n, but since it remained constant the process is still linear.
for the if statment in line 27 to 30 they may have been multipled, but the process still ended up linear since it didnt increment in any higher than 1
or in better terms n did not increment logarithmically, factorially, etc...
